Steps:

1. Analyse all the changes and group files by relevant changes
2. For each group:
   a. Stage the group's files with `git add`
   b. Commit with a message following conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `revert:`
3. Push all commits to remote with `git push`
